Objective: Definiton and development of a completetest case for the simple
3D Display System.

Requirements: Trace on paper all the operations of the basic
3D graphics system to draw the 6 faces of a single cube (show all computations)

The cube is to be viewed with the focal point at the upper left corner
of the cube (0,1,0) and the camera position and orientation (r=25, 0=45, a=0)

1) show all function calls and their parameters
2) show all matricies that need to be calculated

  * 3D transform
  * Camera transform
  * Display transform

????????????????????
1) Get camera transform
2) Apply to all points

??????????????
*) can make aT the identity matrix!
